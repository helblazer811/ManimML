Visualizing Neural Networks with ManimML
========================================

This is a tutorial on how to make neural network architecture visualizations
and animate common algorithms like the forward pass of a neural network. 
Neural networks are a ubiquitous class of machine learning techniques. 
One of the primary usecases for ManimML is for generating animations of neural network architectures.
We have attempted to construct a simple API for defining neural network architectures 
that should feel native to anyone who has used popular deep learning libraries like Pytorch, Tensorflow, and Keras. 
User's can define a sequence of layers and we prove a system for automatically generating various 
animations of concepts like a forward pass. We also allow the user to change the style of rendered 
architectures and algorithm animations. 

For this tutorial we assume that you have already followed the :doc:`Getting Started <getting_started>` tutorial.
This tutorial goes over several simple topics:

1. Generating a simple feed forward neural network diagram
2. Animating the forward pass of a feed forward neural network
3. Generating a diagram of a convolutional neural network
4. Modifying the default style of a neural network

The topics of other tutorials will include:

1. Creating custom neural network layers
2. Creating custom animations of neural networks
